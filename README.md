# Prompt 2: Writing Machines

> By accepting the invitation to play...a broad range of writers can begin to explore the affordances of computation as an expressive medium.

## Readings

### Theory

* [Writing with machines: Data and process in Taroko Gorge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ME9YPH7oUz-JA8suGTHVS42QHDr9Gm03/view?usp=share_link)
* [Text Generation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wX0Hm4R4F21bxvim00hTurAJCDr6AFoF/view?usp=share_link)

### Practice

* _#!_
  * [Excepts from _#!_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wWunc1jbqFC5nrAmztyf9G_I7ZoGtHpV/view?usp=sharing)

#### Python

* [taroko.py](src/examples/taroko.py)
* [house.py](src/examples/house.py)

#### Javascript

* [taroko.js](src/examples/taroko.js)
* [house.hs](src/examples/house.js)

### Documentation

* [nodeJS installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

I provide a link to the `nodeJS` installer, as we'll look at some aspects of Javascript together during lab, so notes taken
on language formats will take place "live."

## Summary

As the epigrapht to this assignment indicates, this week is _somewhat_ about "play." In the spirit of our previous exploration of prompts,
we continue to understand what it means to say that the "[work] stops when the [process] has been elaborated." While Brown points out that 
"poems cannot be so easily linked back to the poet," he admits that "[t]o be sure there is no Taroko Gorge [without its author]."

In this prompt, we investigate what it means to be a dual author: one of process and product, with more control over the range of "puppetry"
that we might employ. Additionally, we take a step back in time and (perhaps forward) in complexity to explore language-_qua_-data-_qua_-technology
further. What does taking _more_ control of the process mean for us? How does it enable or limit our creativity? Is there a way to solve
these questions in our quest for expressive programming?

## Goals

* Explore pure code as an expressive medium
* Gain an introduction to Javascript, particularly the `nodeJS`/`ES6` varieties
* Highlight differences and similarities between Javascript and Python
* Engage with developing "writing machines"

## Outcomes

* 2 poems which engage the idea of writing machines and programming languages
  * 1 which is a remix of "Taroko Gorge"
  * 1 which presents an original writing machine
* 1 of these must be written in Javascript
* 1 of these must be written in Python

## Process

This repository contains two (2) files essential to making this assignment "happen". They are all contained in the `src` folder. Each is a "shell"
for code that you will write in response to this week's charge.

### Remix

When developing your remix, you might think about modifying the Taroko Gorge code in one of two ways:

1. Changing _functionality_
2. Changing _data_

Several of the examples below do one or both.

* [Takei, George; Mark Sample](https://www.samplereality.com/elit/takeigeorge.html)
  * Modification conceptualized around the actor playing Lieutenant Sulu on _Star Trek_
* [Taroko Gary; Leonardo Flores](https://academic.uprm.edu/flores/TarokoGary.html)
  * A reframing of the text around the poet Gary Snider
* [Tokyo Garage; Scott Rettberg](https://retts.net/tokyogarage.html)
  * A spirited rework of the original that converts it to a pirate/motorcycle gang narrative?
  * More notes about this version [here](https://elmcip.net/sites/default/files/media/critical_writing/attachments/a_response_to_nick_montfort.pdf)

### New machines

Nick Montfort's _#!_ explores several different ways to invoke code to create poems. Some are very readable, some aren't. Many are homages
to other work referenced in the Funkhouser reading attached to this prompt. Each investigate one of the various types that Funkhouser comes
up with:

* Combinatoric
  * Limited word lists into new combinations
* Permutational
  * Elements of words into new "things"
* "Slotted" (i.e. "Templated")
  * Combinatoric, but make much more "sense" due to grammatical concerns forced on them

Choosing one (or more?) of these categories, develop your own writing machine. For those of you who need permission to do so: LIBERATE YOURSELF
FROM THE NEED TO MAKE SENSE. As we've discovered with our more inscrutable works so far, we like the challenge of deciphering.
